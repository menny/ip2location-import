An improved PHP script for ip2location (http://phpweby.com/software/ip2country).
This import.php file will take a CSV from http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoIPCountryCSV.zip and insert it into the database.
This script is an improvment over phpweby version so it also supports MySQL servers with 'max_allowed_packet' lower than the size of the input CSV file.

read here http://phpweby.com/software/ip2country for how to use. Just replace the original import.php file from http://phpweby.com/software/ip2country with my version.

BTW, if your server is behind some load-balancer or proxy (like when hosting in Amazon's AWS), the ip2country will fail detecting the client IP.
Use 
function get_client_ip()
{
	$ip = isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']) ? $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] : $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
	return $ip;
}

to get the client's real IP.
